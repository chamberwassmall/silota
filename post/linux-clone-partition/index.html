As told earlier we will backup LVM instead of partition but the steps should be the same to clone a partition. Cloning entire partition to partition is easy with dd command. And expand the partitions once the drive has been cloned. Partclone behavior is different since it can smartly interact with the most common filesystem types backing up only the used blocks of a partition obtaining much smaller backups.</p>
